# Project2-VideoPoker

This is the second project I undertook during week 8 of the 16 week [CodeClan](http://www.codeclan.com) immersive programming course. I wrote my own brief for this project, setting a conservative MVP that I met swifty allowing me to focus on extensions. The core game logic was developed via TDD in plain Java. I then transferred this logic into an Android project with a full UI and a SQLite database to record the game history.
